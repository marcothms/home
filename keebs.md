## Mechanical Keyboards
Ever since I bought my first keeb, I'm in love with them and can never go back
to a normal pre-built one.
But I'm just a beginner, so go easy on me.

#### DZ60
My first DIY keyboard with _Trybosys_ lubed _Gateron Yellows_ with _GMK Noel_.
Whilst not being perfect in the slightest, I'm really proud how it turned out.

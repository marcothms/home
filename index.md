## About me

Hello, I'm Marco _MarcMK_ Thomas, a software development student from Munich, Germany,
born in the summer of 2001.
I spend most of my time learning new software stuff,
gaming or building a new mechanical keyboard.

### Study
I started to get into programming and UNIX-stuff in late 2019, when I joined
[genua GmbH](https://www.genua.de/) as an apprentice. There I learned all about
Linux, BSDs (especially [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org)), Networking and what not.
A year later I started my bachelor's degree in computer science.

Another study, which I dedicate some of my free time to is learning Japanese.
I'm not spending tons of time on it, but after starting in late 2019 I'm now
around A2/B1 level.

### Software Development
I love to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for generic programming,
but also for [embedded computing](https://github.com/rust-embedded).
I own some STM-chip equipped boards to tinker around with.
Other languages I can (comfortably) use include Python, C and Haskell.

### Keyboards
[Here](./keebs.md) I have a collection of photos and some trivia about my keebs.

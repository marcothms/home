## About me

Hello, I'm Marco _MarcMK_ Thomas, a software development student from Munich, Germany.
I spend most of my time learning new software stuff, gaming or building a new mechanical keyboard.

### Keyboards
Most of my build will be on my twitter, because it's a hassle to maintain the
images in some place.
Linear switches all the way!

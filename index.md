## About me

Hello, I'm Marco _MarcMK_ Thomas, a software development student from Munich, Germany.
I spend most of my time learning new software stuff,
gaming or building a new mechanical keyboard.

### Keyboards
[Here](./keebs.md) I have a collection and some trivia about my keebs.
Linear switches all the way!
